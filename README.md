# Overview

This project is a modular Python-based task management framework featuring:

A Flask API server to interact with clients.

A backend task executor.

A custom HTTP server creation class template.

**The system supports:**

DNS queries.

HTTP GET requests.

Dynamic creation of HTTP servers.

Listing all active http servers.

Stopping an active http server.

It is extendable, supports parallel task execution, and ensures efficient HTTP servers creation and management, all from a single API server as requested!

## Project Structure

**1. Main API Task Initiator Server (Main_API_Initiator.py)**
This file acts as the entry point for the system and implements a Flask-based REST API.

Routing of the Endpoints:

/run_task: Executes a single task based on the provided task name and parameters (dns_query, http_get, create_http_server_task).

/run_tasks: Executes multiple tasks in parallel and returns results for all.

/active_servers: Lists all currently active HTTP servers, including their server_id, port, and page_uri.

/stop_server: Stops an active server by specifying the server_id.

**Task Execution Flow**
  
The Flask server routes incoming API requests to the backend API tasks for processing.

HTTP related Tasks are executed based on the task name and parameters.

Example Usage

```bash
POST {Main_Flask_IP}:{Main_Flask_Port}/run_task
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "task_name": "dns_query",
  "params": {
    "domain": "example.com"
  }
}
```
```bash
{Main_Flask_IP}:{Main_Flask_Port}/run_tasks
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_name": "dns_query",
      "params": { "domain": "example.com" }
    },
    {
      "task_name": "http_get_request",
      "params": { 
        "domain_or_ip": "example.com", 
        "port": 443, 
        "uri": "/" 
      }
    },
    {
      "task_name": "create_http_server",
      "params": { 
        "port": 50010, 
        "page_uri": "/test", 
        "response_data": "This is a test page!" 
      }
    }
  ]
}


```

**2. API Tasks File (Server_Tasks.py)**

This module implements the backend logic for executing tasks the tasks. 

**Features**

Centralized task execution logic for scalability.

Extendable to add new tasks by modifying the Main API class.

Validates inputs for robust error handling,


**3. HTTP Server Template (Http_Server_Template.py)**

This module provides the logic for creating and managing HTTP servers using Python's HTTPServer.

**Key Functionalities**

Create New HTTP Servers

Dynamically starts a new server on the specified port and URI.

Tracks each server with a unique server_id.

Track Active Servers.

Maintains a dictionary of active servers (port, URI, server thread).

Prevents duplication of servers on the same port or URI.

Ensures a maximum of 10 servers are active.

Validates port and URI availability before starting a new server.

Safely shuts down servers when requested.


## Running the Framework

```python
#Dependencies
pip install flask requests pytest

# starting the main server to receive tasks
python Main_API_Initiator


url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000/run_task"
#domain query task
payload = {
    "task_name": "dns_query",
    "params": {
        "domain": "example.com"
    }
}
response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
print(response.json())


#http get task
payload = {
    "task_name": "http_get_request",
    "params": {
        "domain_or_ip": "example.com",
        "port": 443,
        "uri": "/"
    }
}
response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
